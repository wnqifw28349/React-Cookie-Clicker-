- This goal of this project was to recreate Cookie Clicker with ReactJS.

Requirements:

- Implemented the useState hook.
- Used useEffect effectively.
- Returned JSX from a source other than App.jsx by using components.
- Applied setInterval to execute periodic tasks within the application, i.e. setCookies in CPS.
- Used the .map() function in RenderUpgrades.jsx to render lists of items in the application dynamically.
- Used logic to manage the purchase and application of upgrade items within the game in UpgradeButton.jsx.

Stretch tasks:

- Used local storage in App.jsx to save and retrieve game data.
- Used the Upgrades API to manage upgrades in RenderUpgrades.jsx.

Extra:

- Added a 'Reset' button that allows users to start from 0 Cookies and 1 CPS.
